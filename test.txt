DHU-Pred - Predictor for Dihydrouridine Sites in tRNA Sequences
The DHU-Pred is a web-server for the prediction of Dihydrouridine in transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications.
Dihydrouridine is formed from the uridine base by reducing the carbon-carbon double bond at positions 5 and 6 as shown in the Figure below.
 The current research study focused on the detection of D modification using a novel method for feature extraction from the RNA samples obtained 
from RMBase containing 1035 Positive Samples from three species including Homosapiens (525) , Mus musculus (435), and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (75) 
and 1396 Negative Samples. Statistical moments are incorporated for the extraction and representation of feature vectors based on the position as
well as the composition of nucleotide bases.
